                    Our mission at the eJuggle Shop is to provide high-quality juggling equipment and accessories to enthusiasts around the world, while also supporting a worthy cause. All of our profits go directly to <a href="https://cwbireland.com" target="_blank">Clowns without Borders</a>, a charity that brings joy and laughter to children in need through entertaining shows and workshops. We believe in the power of play and laughter to bring hope and healing, and we are proud to contribute to this important work through the sale of our products.
